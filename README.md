# Chat Application

This is a simple chat app built using Python Django Framework. To test the application take the following steps:
* Open up the website on two different browsers [Link](https://replit.com/@Julius777/ChatApp).
* Enter the same room name to subscribe to that room
* Enter two different usernames.
* Send and recieve messages between both users

## Installing packages
For local installations django and sql can be installed via pip otherwise a Django template can be setup on replit.
If doing a local installation the following setups need to be done
* Set up a virtual environment
* Install Django
* Pin your project dependencies
* Set up a Django project
* Start a Django app

The following bash commands run post installation will result in Django creating its default folder structure for your project and app
```bash
django-admin startproject <project-name>
django-admin startproject setup
python manage.py startapp <appname>
```
